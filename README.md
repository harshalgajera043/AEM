# Time Series Forecasting and SQL Data Processing Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a time series forecasting model using SARIMA and Prophet, along with SQL-based data extraction for inventory, sales, and purchase data. The project uses a dummy dataset with 26 columns simulating real-world transactions, providing insights for optimizing inventory management and supply chain decisions.

## Key Features
### Time Series Forecasting:

### SARIMA and Prophet: Time series models for forecasting inventory valuation trends.
Predict future inventory levels and identify patterns in historical data.
## SQL Data Processing:

SQL scripts to extract Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Work Orders, Transfer Orders, and Inventory Adjustments from NetSuite.
Generate real-time reports for inventory monitoring and decision-making.
Dataset
## The dummy dataset contains 10,000 rows and 26 columns, including:

1. Item_Type, Item_ID, Purchase_ID, Sales_ID
2. Qty, Price, Cost, Inventory_Valuation
3. Stock_Level, Customer_ID, Region, and more.


## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7+ and SQL basics.
2. Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn, fbprophet.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository and download the dataset dummy_inventory_data.csv.
2. Run the Python script for time series forecasting:
python Time_Series_Forecasting_SARIMA_Prophet_Harshal_Gajera.py
3. Modify and execute the SQL script for data extraction.
## Experience
Through this project, I developed forecasting models and SQL queries to streamline inventory monitoring, contributing to efficient supply chain management and decision-making.
